description : |
    <p>Converts an externally generated assembly file object uploaded to KBase to a set of contigs in KBase format. Currently, assembly files are generated when transferring to KBase assembled genomes generated by internal pipelines at Joint Genome Institute (JGI) via the Push to KBase feature. An assembly file object is a FASTA file containing the genomic sequence of an organism that has been assembled from sequencing reads. The method simply converts the assembly file into the KBase contigs data type.</p>
